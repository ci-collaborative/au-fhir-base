**Extension: Delivery Point Identifier** *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This extension applies to the Address datatype and is used to represent an Australia Post Delivery Point Identifier (DPID).

A DPID[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://auspost.com.au/business/marketing-and-communications/access-data-and-insights/supporting-our-data-partners/address-data){:target="_blank"} [<sup>[2]</sup>](https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/430306){:target="_blank"} is a randomly generated, unique 8-digit number, allocated by Australia Post to an address. A DPID enables each delivery point in Australia to be uniquely identified.

**Examples**

[Postal address (with DPID) and work address in Darwin, NT](Patient-address-example0.html)
